Create a program for a movie cinema. It will be used to
keep track of ticket sales throughout the day. The
program should do the following:
Keep asking for tickets until the end of the day
(maybe ask the user "Do you want to sell
another ticket? (Y/N) ")
Tickets sold are either Adult, Student, Child, or
they use a Gift Voucher.
When a ticket is sold, print the price of
the ticket to the user:
• Adult $12.50
• Student $9.00
• Child $7.00
Gift Voucher is free
When a ticket is sold, keep track of how
many are sold of each type.
At the end of the day, print out the total tickets
sold/used, how many tickets were sold of each
type, and the total value of tickets.
Advanced challenge: Allow the user to cancel
buying a ticket
