Donald is a gentle soul who loves to read. Unfortunately of the last few years he has developed a horrible
aversion to the letter "q". Unfortunately he has been asked to look through a huge list of words and this is causing
him an enormous amount of stress.
Your task is to write a program that replaces all the letter q's with a letter "p" (which will save Donald a great deal
of distress)
